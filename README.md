## Description
This application offers a small coding quiz generated entirely using JavaScript and the browser's default Web API. It contains a start button, which triggers both an interval timer and the questions and answers to appear. When a question is answered, the accuracy of the response is stored and the next question appears. The application also utilizes local storage, storing up to five high scores along with the user's initials.
